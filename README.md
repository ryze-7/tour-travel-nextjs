# Tour & Travel Website — Next.js

This is a dynamic tour and travel website built with **Next.js** where all tour packages, destinations, pricing, and itineraries are managed using **Google Sheets**.

The goal of this project is to let a travel agency update their website content without needing any technical knowledge or developer support.

## How It Works

The business owner adds or edits tour data in Google Sheets.  
That data is converted into an API and automatically fetched by the Next.js app.  
The website updates itself whenever the sheet is changed.

There is no traditional backend or admin panel.

## What This Solves

Most small travel businesses struggle to keep their websites updated.  
This system allows them to manage their entire website using a simple spreadsheet instead.
